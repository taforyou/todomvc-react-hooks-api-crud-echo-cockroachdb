# Real go(echo)API CRUD TodoMVC with react hooks cockroachdb

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

was modified from [Real API CRUD TodoMVC with react hooks](https://github.com/sergey-s/todomvc-react-hooks-api-crud)

## These are step to follow in order to work properly

## Step 1 : yarn build

First we have to build static files to let go(echo) to serve

and you will have folder structure
## Step 2 : init local cockroachdb by docker

Second, YOU MUST installed docker in your machine then write Dockerfile 

*Normaly we often use NGINX to serve static files, but i'm lazy to config :)
